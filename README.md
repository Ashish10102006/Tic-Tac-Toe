# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is my **first project** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, where I have built a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game.  

Through this project, I have learned and applied important web development concepts such as:  

- **DOM Manipulation** – accessing and updating HTML elements dynamically.  
- **Event Listeners** – responding to user clicks on the game board and buttons.  
- **Functions** – creating reusable blocks of code for checking wins, resetting the game, and handling turns.  
- **Loops** – iterating through arrays to check winning patterns.  
- **Conditional Statements** – controlling game logic such as turn changes, detecting a winner, or a draw.  
- **Styling and Animations** – using CSS for hover effects, transitions, and highlighting winning boxes.  

The game features:  
- Interactive 3x3 grid for playing Tic-Tac-Toe.  
- Highlights the winning combination.  
- Displays winner or draw messages dynamically.  
- Reset and New Game functionality for replaying.  

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of **JavaScript logic, DOM interactions, and dynamic UI updates**, which are essential for building interactive web applications.
